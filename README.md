# Simple Customized printf Project

## Description
This project is a simplified implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The goal is to create a customized `printf` that can handle basic data types such as integers, characters, and strings. This project serves as an educational exercise to understand how the `printf` function works internally under the supervsion of ALX.

## Features
- Supports formatting and printing of integers (decimal and hexadecimal).
- Supports formatting and printing of characters.
- Supports formatting and printing of strings.
- Provides a basic understanding of how the `printf` function can be implemented.

## How to Use
include the files and the header of the project called `main.h` in your files and use the name of the customized function `_printf()` for using the customized function. the funtion would provide the same functionallity as the normal `printf()` in the stdio.h library.
## Contribution
Feel free to modify and extend this project to suit your specific needs. You can enhance it by adding additional selectors of data types, like printing address and others. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
